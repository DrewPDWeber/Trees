# TreeFriend

> Inspired by The Trillion Tree Campaign, TreeFriend is a gaming concept that aims to facilitate a relationship between the players and the trees that they live with and/or have planted themselves. This is done by having the players catalogue trees that are not in the database, to disseminate information about cataloged trees to players, and to assist the players to track the development of trees, especially those that they have planted, over time. The hope is not only to encourage players to plant trees themselves and to educate players about their environment but also to develop a friendship with trees special to them and a custodial kind of attitude towards the maintenance of trees.
