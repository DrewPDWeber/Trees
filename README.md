# TreeFriend

Inspired by The Trillion Tree Campaign, TreeFriend is a gaming concept that aims to facilitate a relationship between the players and the trees that they live with and/or have planted themselves. This is done by having the players catalogue trees that are not in the database, to disseminate information about cataloged trees to players, and to assist the players to track the development of trees, especially those that they have planted, over time. The hope is not only to encourage players to plant trees themselves and to educate players about their environment but also to develop a friendship with trees special to them and a custodial kind of attitude towards the maintenance of trees.


Requirements
-The app can track the users location and use it to update the location on a player map.

-’Tree’ objects can be added to the map using the players current location and information about the tree can be attached to the new tree object.

-Players can interact with an existing tree object by walking up to one in RL and clicking on it. Upon clicking a window will pop up detailing the trees information like: plant date, registry date, tree species, and tree common name.

- Registered trees will only populate the map within the local vicinity.

-Users will have personal accounts that will keep track of the trees that they have ‘met’, and how long since their last encounter.

-Daily challenges could consist of “meeting a new tree”, and looking at which trees the user has already ‘met’, their last encounter date and having the player ‘reacquaint’ themselves with the a tree that they haven’t visited in a long time.
